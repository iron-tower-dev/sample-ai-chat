A set of FSFs is defined. These FSFs (defined by an earlier TICAP activity (Southern Company Document Number SC-16166-100[4]) are the following: \n\n1. Retaining Radioactive Materials   \n2. Controlling Reactivity   \n3. Removing Heat from the Reactor and Waste Stores \n\nTICAP will use the NEI 18-04-based safety case to formulate its content proposal. NEI 18-04 included a set of FSFs that were also endorsed by the NRC in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233. The set of FSFs contained in NEI 18-04 and RG 1.233 are, respectively: \n\nControlling heat generation, controlling heat removal, and retaining radionuclides, and Reactivity and power control, heat removal, and radionuclide retention. \n\nTICAP has evaluated the differences between the set defined in SC-16166-100 and those contained in NEI 18-04 and RG 1.233 and has concluded that the sets of FSFs are functionally equivalent. \n\nThese FSFs provide comprehensive coverage of important plant functions for a spectrum of reactor technologies and postulated initiating events and design basis accidents that, if demonstrated, will provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the health and safety of the public and the environment. \n\nB. The current LWR requirements are mapped to the above FSFs. The objective is to demonstrate that the existing design requirements contained in 10 CFR Parts 50 and 52 (and regulations referenced by those parts) are in place to substantiate that one or more fundamental safety functions are met.   \nC. The LWR General Design Criteria are organized into information categories that provide answers to the following questions:   \n\u2022 What are the performance objectives for the FSFs?   \n\u2022 When do the FSF\u2019s performance objectives need to be demonstrated?   \n\u2022 How plant capabilities (functional and structural) demonstrate that the FSFs are met? \n\n\n\nHow well do these capacities need to be performed to provide reasonable assurance?\n\n---\n\n**Source 62**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 63**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 11/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 64**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 10/31/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 65**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 9/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 66**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 01/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 67**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 6/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 68**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 69**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 04/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 70**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 08/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 71**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 03/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 72**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 73**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 04/30/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 74**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 10/31/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 75**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 08/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 76**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 07/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 77**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 6/30/2017)\n\n---\n\n**Source 78**\nJanuary 7, 2021 (Part 53 \u2013 Design and Analysis Requirements (Subpart C) Preliminary Language to be Issued Around December 18, 2020) \n\nJanuary 21, 2021 (Periodic) \n\nNext TICAP/ARCAP Meeting?\n\n---\n\n**Source 79**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 06/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 80**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 09/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 81**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 11/30/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 82**\nTo standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, the staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project (TICAP).

This report will define a set of FSFs for review by and discussion with the NRC. The recommended set of FSFs will be evaluated as part of the ongoing TICAP activities with the idea of evolving the definitions, if necessary, to assure maximum inclusivity of technology options. \n\nThe objective of this report is to recommend a set of FSFs that embody the underlying safety objectives of the technical requirements within the scope of the current SAR portion of the application for operating a commercial nuclear power plant. The set of FSFs will serve as a common set of functions that the safety case for all designs (independent of the technology) would address. It will also serve as a reference for the next phases of the TICAP efforts to identify the necessary information that demonstrates that these FSFs are met. The NRC has not yet issued final regulatory guidance or made a policy decision that specifically defines a set of FSFs to be used for regulatory purposes. Therefore, alignment on the FSFs is a necessary first step in developing the guidance envisioned by the subsequent TICAP activities that, when demonstrated, will satisfy the underlying public safety objective of the Atomic Energy Act.\n\n---\n\n**Source 89**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 12/31/2015)\n\n---\n\n**Source 90**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 12/31/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 91**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (AS OF 10/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 92**\nTopics 10 and 12 from the list found in Enclosure 2 associated with level of defense-in-depth information provided in the SAR \n\nThis issue was also identified as a result of the TICAP tabletop exercises. The staff noted that NEI 18-04 provides important defense-in-depth considerations that the staff noted should be captured in the SAR. Industry believes only the results should be captured in the SAR. The staff took an action to provide examples of documentation that would be expected to be captured in the SAR based on the guidance in NEI 18-04. These examples will be provided to industry and discussed at an upcoming workshop. \n\nTopic 20 from the list found in Enclosure 2 associated with the scope of industry\u2019s TICAP guidance and where guidance such as fuel qualification, ASME Section III Division 5, instrumentation and control design review guide, and siting will be found. Industry\u2019s TICAP guidance is focused on the first 8 chapters of the SAR and applies NEI 18-04 concepts to these chapters. The staff noted that important information such as siting would be expected to be found in the first 8 chapters of the SAR and that supplemental guidance for siting should be provided. The staff took an action to provide white papers on drafts of a TICAP regulatory guide and an Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project roadmap interim staff guidance that preliminarily provides pointers on how industry\u2019s TICAP guidance could be supplemented based on important guidance that the staff is developing.\n\n---\n\n**Source 93**\nThank you for recognizing the purpose of the exercise and explicitly making this statement. \n\nVI. The SAR content should focus on presenting the results of implementing the LMP process. For discussion purposes, it may be beneficial to discuss what type of documentation may exist from implementing the LMP process by the applicant, including narrative on the iterations in the process, and the deliberations and decisions of the integrated decisionmaking process (IDP) and whether this documentation may be something that is audited by the NRC staff. \n\nThis topic is a good candidate to be discussed during the TICAP workshops with the NRC/INL staff. \n\nAreas of Requested Feedback \n\nI. What inconsistencies, if any, were noted between the sample SAR content discussed during the 3/5 tabletop and NRC expectations. \n\na. NEI 18-04 (Section 3.2.2 \u2013 Task 6) states that, where possible, external events are to be analyzed in the PRA but, in some cases, may be selected and treated deterministically. There is no discussion in the TICAP guidance document about how to select and treat external events selected using a deterministic approach. Accordingly, the VTR report did not address this topic. For deterministically selected external events, it is not clear how they can be plotted on the frequency-consequence (F-C) curve since there is no frequency associated with the events. The discussion around this topic did not lead to a clear understanding of which external events are selected and treated deterministically and how they are compared to the F-C curve. \n\nWe think that this question is an interesting one and requires further clarification and discussion. We suggest that this topic be discussed at the upcoming TICAP workshops between the TICAP team and NRC/INL staff.\n\n---\n\n**Source 94**\nRationale for TICAP Approach to Developing PDC \n\nIn the June 23, 2021, public meeting,11 NRC staff members posited that the description of PDC provided in the Introduction section of Appendix A of 10 CFR 50 (provided above) may be a regulatory requirement, such that, without directly relating/comparing design-specific PDC to ARDC, the above-described TICAP strategy of focusing the PDC strictly on functional design criteria may not comply with current NRC regulations and thus may require an exemption. Notably, this staff position did not reflect input from the Office of General Counsel. Moreover, in that same meeting, the NRC staff acknowledged that the ARDC \u201c . . . are not considered to be final or binding regarding what may eventually be required from a nonLWR applicant.\u201d12 This position that the ARDC are not binding is consistent with the established \n\nunderstanding of a regulatory guide as being one of multiple methods for meeting regulatory expectations.13 \n\nFrom the perspective of the TICAP team, the TICAP proposal is sufficient to satisfy the basic requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(a)(3)(i) or equivalent, and this methodology does not require exemptions because the proposed TICAP approach for describing the design-specific safety case (which includes describing PDC, CDC, and programmatic requirements): \n\nHas been shown to provide the information that covers the intent of the applicable safety concepts included in ARDC; and \u2022 Would include required design-specific safety features identified by the RIPB LMP approach that may not be included in the ARDC (or GDC).\n\n---\n\n**Source 95**\nAlthough it was mentioned during the tabletop meeting and will be stated in the MCRE tabletop report, it is worth clarifying that the comparison of RIPB-derived PDC to the list of GDC/ARDC was an \u201cacademic exercise.\u201d NEI 18-04 does not require performing a comparison of final PDC to the GDC/ARDC, and the TICAP guidance does not call for including information on such a comparison in the SAR. TICAP does not believe that generating the comparison should be a de facto requirement on an applicant that follows NEI 18-04, but this could be candidate topic for an upcoming TICAP workshop. \n\nIII. The NRC staff notes that Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 18-04 describes how you can use the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) at the beginning or at the end of the LMP process. If not used at the beginning of the LMP process, other tools such as a process hazards analysis (PHA) or a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) are used and then confirmed at the end of the LMP process via the PRA. However, the LMP did not appear to be used to develop frequency-consequence (F-C) curves (used for licensing basis event (LBE) identification and structure, system, and component (SSC) classification). How the PRA will be used to adjust the LBEs or SSC classification would be of interest to the NRC staff. \n\nIt is correct to say that a full iteration of the LMP process (as documented in NEI 18-04) has not yet been completed for MCRE; however, given the current maturity of the MCRE design and safety case, it was necessary to make assumptions to \u201csimulate\u201d a more complete safety case for MCRE in order to explore the TICAP guidance by exercising it. The adjusting of the LBEs and/or SSC classification as a MCRE PRA model is developed and matured would be the topic of an LMP-focused discussion; thus, a conversation on this topic would not be well-suited to discuss at the upcoming TICAP workshops. \n\nI. What inconsistencies, if any, were noted between the sample SAR content discussed during the MCRE tabletop and NRC expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Source 96**\nTo standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating a consistent approach to the development of application documents. \n\nThe TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, \u201cGuidance for a Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,\u201d (ADAMS Accession No. ML20091L698).\n\n---\n\n**Source 97**\nAs noted above, a more detailed discussion about the information and level of detail included in the SAR compared to what is available for the NRC staff audit will be a topic of conversation in the upcoming workshops between the NRC staff and the TICAP team. \n\nIV. It was insightful for the NRC staff to see how the LMP process is applied as well as the level of detail/complexity for developing a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a simple microreactor design. \n\nThank you for the observation. The eVinci Micro-Reactor tabletop report will document the lessons learned from completing the tabletop exercise. \n\nV. The tabletop exercise involved an approach used by Westinghouse to develop PDCs. Westinghouse went directly from development of the required safety functions (RSFs) to defining the PDCs. NEI 18-04 states (under Task 7) that for SSCs classified as SafetyRelated (SR), the Safety-Related Design Criteria (SRDCs) are derived from the Required Functional Design Criteria (RFDCs) that are in turn developed from the RSFs determined in the LBE selection process. RFDCs are taken down from the RSFs to a lower level and form a transition to SSC-level criteria. RFDCs are defined to capture design-specific criteria that may be used to supplement or modify the applicable General Design Criteria (GDCs) or Advanced Reactor Design Criteria (ARDCs) in the formulation of PDCs. This approach appeared to the observation team to result in gaps in information that would be incorporated into the SAR content. \n\nAccording to the TICAP guidance, the PDC are the RFDC, which (as noted in the observation) are derived directly from the RSFs. Therefore, in Chapter 5 of a SAR developed using the TICAP guidance, the RSFs and the RFDC/PDC would be presented. Chapter 6 would present the SR-SSCs and the SRDC. The presentation of the PDC in Chapter 5, including the associated additional information, is a topic that would be a good candidate to discuss during the upcoming workshops between the NRC staff and the TICAP team.\n\n---\n\n**Source 98**\nI. The tabletop exercise did not fully accomplish its goal of exercising the TICAP application content guidance. No SAR content was presented or discussed. Instead, the tabletop exercise was a \u201cmini\u201d version of the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP) tabletop exercise that was performed in 2020, using some revised design features (TRISO fuel) and only evaluating for principal design criteria (PDCs). (Note that the 2020 LMP tabletop exercise did not evaluate for PDCs.) The tabletop exercise also did not perform some of the analysis that would be expected for development of licensing basis events, required safety functions, and PDCs, such as not evaluating the failure of all important structures, systems, and components (SSCs) (heat pipes and fuel), not calculating parametric uncertainties and not performing external hazards assessment. \n\nAlthough the eVinci Micro-Reactor tabletop exercise did not explicitly develop example SAR content (like the other tabletop exercises), the primary focus was on the identification of PDC using the TICAP guidance. Also, while the above observation is correct in its identification that the LMP-based safety case for the eVinci Micro-Reactor design that was used for the TICAP tabletop exercise is not entirely complete, the exercise did accomplish its goal to exercise the TICAP guidance document and explore how to maximize the usefulness of the guidance in explaining how PDC are identified using the TICAP approach. PDC are required by regulation and were not addressed in detail by LMP; thus, this exercise was necessary to help ensure the gap between the guidance in NEI 18-04 (and endorsed in RG 1.233) was sufficiently bridged by the TICAP guidance document.\n\n---\n\n**Source 99**\nWith respect to the design of safety related SSCs, external events are addressed in Chapter 6 of the TICAP guidance through the DBEHLs and Safety Related Design Criteria. However, it may be possible to use the body of the tabletop report to communicate further context and details about the selection of external events beyond that which the TICAP guidance indicates should be included in the SAR. \n\nf. The VTR report states that a PRA self-assessment identified some gaps in Capability Category II requirements of the non-LWR PRA standard. It may be useful to specifically discuss the gaps and their resolutions in the PRA summary of the SAR or a peer review report for audit. \n\nThe NLWR PRA Standard requirements for peer review and configuration control and the NEI PRA Peer Review Guidance specify that peer review findings and dispositions be documented in the plant records and associated corrective actions programs. The dispositions of these findings is a rather dynamic process and is subject to frequent changes and this creates a major problem for inclusion in the SAR. Hence this matter is best handled via the on-site audit process. \n\nIII. What other clarifying questions, if any, does the NRC have based on NRC/INL team observations.\n\n---\n\n**Source 100**\nForm APC-2 (4-47)\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Step 2: LLM Reasoning (Thinking Mode)\nThe user is asking again about TICAP, which is the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project. I should provide a clear and concise response based on the context information available.\n\nFrom the context, I can see several relevant sources about TICAP:\n\nSource 82: \"The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach.

This report will define a set of FSFs for review by and discussion with the NRC.\"\n\nSource 61: Describes the fundamental safety functions (FSFs) that TICAP addresses, including \"Retaining Radioactive Materials,\" \"Controlling Reactivity,\" and \"Removing Heat from the Reactor and Waste Stores.\"\n\nSince this is a repeated question, I should provide a concise answer based on the most relevant sources. I'll format it as a JSON object with the 'response' and 'source_indices' keys as requested.\n\nFor the response, I'll include key information about what TICAP is, its purpose, and its relationship to other initiatives like ARCAP.\n\nFor source_indices, I'll include the relevant sources that provide information about TICAP.\n\n---\n\n# Step 3: LLM Generated Answer\nTICAP stands for the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project, which is an industry-led activity focused on providing guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to specific portions of the safety analysis report (SAR) for non-light water reactors (non-LWRs). TICAP specifically addresses the fundamental safety functions of the design and documents the safety analysis using the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP)-based approach described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233. The fundamental safety functions (FSFs) that TICAP addresses include retaining radioactive materials, controlling reactivity, and removing heat from the reactor and waste stores. TICAP works alongside the NRC-led Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) to standardize the development of content for non-LWR applications under 10 CFR Parts 50 and 52 [Source: 61, 82, 88, 96].\n\n Source Indices: [61, 82, 88, 96]\n\n---\n\n# Step 4: Guardrail Reasoning (Thinking Mode)\nWe need to verify the answer. The user question: \"What is TICAP?\" The answer provided earlier: They defined TICAP, its purpose, FSFs, etc. We need to check if the answer completely answers the question. The question is simply \"What is TICAP?\" Likely expects a definition and purpose. The answer given: \"TICAP stands for the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project, which is an industry-led activity focused on providing guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to specific portions of the safety analysis report (SAR) for non-light water reactors (non-LWRs). TICAP specifically addresses the fundamental safety functions of the design and documents the safety analysis using the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP)-based approach.

TICAP aims to define a common set of FSFs that the safety case for all reactor designs would address, regardless of technology, and to identify the necessary information that demonstrates these FSFs are met.\"\n\nCheck sources: The answer references sources 61, 82, 88, 96. The content matches those sources. Let's verify each part.\n\nSource 61: describes FSFs and that TICAP will use NEI 18-04-based safety case. It lists FSFs: Retaining Radioactive Materials, Controlling Reactivity, Removing Heat from Reactor and Waste Stores. So FSFs part correct.\n\nSource 82: describes TICAP as industry-led activity focused on guiding scope and depth of SAR info related to FSFs, using LMP-based approach described in RG 1.233. Also mentions ARCAP and the purpose.\n\nSource 88: describes the report setting FSFs and that it's part of ongoing TICAP activities; also the objective to recommend FSFs, etc. So mention of FSFs and purpose.\n\nSource 96: similar to 82: industry-led activity focusing on guidance, LMP-based approach, etc.\n\nThus answer is accurate.\n\nDoes it fully answer the question? The question: \"What is TICAP?\" The answer provides definition, purpose, FSFs, relationship to ARCAP, etc. That seems sufficient.

The LMP-based approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, \\u201cGuidance for a Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,\\u201d (ADAMS Accession No. ML20091L698).\",\n      \"bounding_boxes\": \"{\\\"2\\\": [[171, 503, 879, 843]], \\\"3\\\": [[173, 88, 883, 330], [171, 343, 877, 650]]}\",\n      \"AuthorName\": \"Lynch S T\",\n      \"milvus_id\": 461505344535897961,\n      \"distance\": 0.0026267152279615402,\n      \"rank\": 109\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n---\n\n# Step 8: All Retrieved Sources Metadata\n[\n  {\n    \"source_id\": 1,\n    \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"AccessionNumber\": \"ML092321032\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"chunk_6\",\n      \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n      \"bounding_boxes\": \"{\\\"7\\\": [[114, 521, 537, 905]]}\",\n      \"AuthorName\": \"Herrera T\",\n      \"milvus_id\": 461505344384635286,\n      \"distance\": 0.0016977929044514894,\n      \"rank\": 220\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"source_id\": 2,\n    \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"AccessionNumber\": \"ML093290086\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"chunk_11\",\n      \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n      \"bounding_boxes\": \"{}\",\n      \"AuthorName\": \"Mattern K S\",\n      \"milvus_id\": 461505344436039817,\n      \"distance\": 0.0016949152341112494,\n      \"rank\": 221\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"source_id\": 3,\n    \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"AccessionNumber\": \"ML100490591\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"chunk_6\",\n      \"text\": \"(From DCIP list)\",\n      \"bounding_boxes\": \"{\\\"7\\\": [[114, 633, 558, 905]]}\",\n      \"AuthorName\": \"Mattern K S\",\n      \"milvus_id\": 461505344485334288,\n      \"distance\": 0.001692047342658043,\n      \"rank\": 222\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"source_id\": 4,\n    \"text\": \"ARCAP Chapter 2, \\\"Site Information\\\" \\n\\nARCAP Chapter 9, \\\"Control of Routine Plant Radioactive Effluents, Plant Contamination, and Solid Waste \\n\\n\\u2022ARCAP Chapter 10, \\\"Control of Occupational Dose\\\" \\n\\nStatus of TICAP and ARCAP Guidance Documents \\n\\nTimeline from October 22, 2020, public meeting updated to reflect status of ARCAP/TICAP guidance documents \\n\\nChanges include addition of interim industry-developed TICAP guidance documents Integration of TICAP and ARCAP guidance documents Overall impact is a slip of approximately 3 months for issuance of TICAP and ARCAP guidance documents \\n\\nStatus of TICAP and ARCAP Guidance Documents \\n\\nAssumptions/Discussion Topics \\n\\nIndustry-developed TICAP guidance document will not include guidance for the specific-portions of the first 8 SAR chapters that are outside the scope of the licensing modernization project (LMP) \\n\\nExamples where guidance is being developed outside the scope of LMP that could affect the first 8 chapters of a SAR are: \\n\\n0 Site information - ARCAP chapter 2   \\n\\u2022 ASME Section III, Division 5 high temperature design guidance   \\nO Fuel qualification guidance \\n\\nOutline (FSAR) \\n\\nGeneral Plant Information, Site Description, and Overview of the Safety Case Generic Analyses Licensing Basis Event (LBE) Analysis Integrated Plant Analysis Safety Functions, Design Criteria, and SSC Categorization   \\n6.

A set of FSFs is defined. These FSFs (defined by an earlier TICAP activity (Southern Company Document Number SC-16166-100[4]) are the following: \n\n1. Retaining Radioactive Materials   \n2. Controlling Reactivity   \n3. Removing Heat from the Reactor and Waste Stores \n\nTICAP will use the NEI 18-04-based safety case to formulate its content proposal. NEI 18-04 included a set of FSFs that were also endorsed by the NRC in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233. The set of FSFs contained in NEI 18-04 and RG 1.233 are, respectively: \n\nControlling heat generation, controlling heat removal, and retaining radionuclides, and Reactivity and power control, heat removal, and radionuclide retention. \n\nTICAP has evaluated the differences between the set defined in SC-16166-100 and those contained in NEI 18-04 and RG 1.233 and has concluded that the sets of FSFs are functionally equivalent. \n\nThese FSFs provide comprehensive coverage of important plant functions for a spectrum of reactor technologies and postulated initiating events and design basis accidents that, if demonstrated, will provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the health and safety of the public and the environment. \n\nB. The current LWR requirements are mapped to the above FSFs. The objective is to demonstrate that the existing design requirements contained in 10 CFR Parts 50 and 52 (and regulations referenced by those parts) are in place to substantiate that one or more fundamental safety functions are met.   \nC. The LWR General Design Criteria are organized into information categories that provide answers to the following questions:   \n\u2022 What are the performance objectives for the FSFs?   \n\u2022 When do the FSF\u2019s performance objectives need to be demonstrated?   \n\u2022 How plant capabilities (functional and structural) demonstrate that the FSFs are met? \n\n\n\nHow well do these capacities need to be performed to provide reasonable assurance?\n\n---\n\n**Source 62**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 63**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 11/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 64**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 10/31/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 65**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 9/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 66**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 01/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 67**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 6/30/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 68**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 69**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 04/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 70**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 08/31/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 71**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 03/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 72**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 05/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 73**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 04/30/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 74**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 10/31/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 75**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 08/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 76**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 07/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 77**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 6/30/2017)\n\n---\n\n**Source 78**\nJanuary 7, 2021 (Part 53 \u2013 Design and Analysis Requirements (Subpart C) Preliminary Language to be Issued Around December 18, 2020) \n\nJanuary 21, 2021 (Periodic) \n\nNext TICAP/ARCAP Meeting?\n\n---\n\n**Source 79**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 06/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 80**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 09/30/2013)\n\n---\n\n**Source 81**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126CA/B) Summary Report (AS OF 11/30/2012)\n\n---\n\n**Source 82**\nTo standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, the staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project (TICAP).

This report will define a set of FSFs for review by and discussion with the NRC. The recommended set of FSFs will be evaluated as part of the ongoing TICAP activities with the idea of evolving the definitions, if necessary, to assure maximum inclusivity of technology options. \n\nThe objective of this report is to recommend a set of FSFs that embody the underlying safety objectives of the technical requirements within the scope of the current SAR portion of the application for operating a commercial nuclear power plant. The set of FSFs will serve as a common set of functions that the safety case for all designs (independent of the technology) would address. It will also serve as a reference for the next phases of the TICAP efforts to identify the necessary information that demonstrates that these FSFs are met. The NRC has not yet issued final regulatory guidance or made a policy decision that specifically defines a set of FSFs to be used for regulatory purposes. Therefore, alignment on the FSFs is a necessary first step in developing the guidance envisioned by the subsequent TICAP activities that, when demonstrated, will satisfy the underlying public safety objective of the Atomic Energy Act.\n\n---\n\n**Source 89**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 12/31/2015)\n\n---\n\n**Source 90**\nOpen Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (As Of 12/31/2016)\n\n---\n\n**Source 91**\nClosed Generic Communication TACs (PA No. 115126) Summary Report (AS OF 10/31/2014)\n\n---\n\n**Source 92**\nTopics 10 and 12 from the list found in Enclosure 2 associated with level of defense-in-depth information provided in the SAR \n\nThis issue was also identified as a result of the TICAP tabletop exercises. The staff noted that NEI 18-04 provides important defense-in-depth considerations that the staff noted should be captured in the SAR. Industry believes only the results should be captured in the SAR. The staff took an action to provide examples of documentation that would be expected to be captured in the SAR based on the guidance in NEI 18-04.

The staff noted that important information such as siting would be expected to be found in the first 8 chapters of the SAR and that supplemental guidance for siting should be provided. The staff took an action to provide white papers on drafts of a TICAP regulatory guide and an Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project roadmap interim staff guidance that preliminarily provides pointers on how industry\u2019s TICAP guidance could be supplemented based on important guidance that the staff is developing.\n\n---\n\n**Source 93**\nThank you for recognizing the purpose of the exercise and explicitly making this statement. \n\nVI. The SAR content should focus on presenting the results of implementing the LMP process. For discussion purposes, it may be beneficial to discuss what type of documentation may exist from implementing the LMP process by the applicant, including narrative on the iterations in the process, and the deliberations and decisions of the integrated decisionmaking process (IDP) and whether this documentation may be something that is audited by the NRC staff. \n\nThis topic is a good candidate to be discussed during the TICAP workshops with the NRC/INL staff. \n\nAreas of Requested Feedback \n\nI. What inconsistencies, if any, were noted between the sample SAR content discussed during the 3/5 tabletop and NRC expectations. \n\na. NEI 18-04 (Section 3.2.2 \u2013 Task 6) states that, where possible, external events are to be analyzed in the PRA but, in some cases, may be selected and treated deterministically. There is no discussion in the TICAP guidance document about how to select and treat external events selected using a deterministic approach. Accordingly, the VTR report did not address this topic. For deterministically selected external events, it is not clear how they can be plotted on the frequency-consequence (F-C) curve since there is no frequency associated with the events. The discussion around this topic did not lead to a clear understanding of which external events are selected and treated deterministically and how they are compared to the F-C curve. \n\nWe think that this question is an interesting one and requires further clarification and discussion. We suggest that this topic be discussed at the upcoming TICAP workshops between the TICAP team and NRC/INL staff.\n\n---\n\n**Source 94**\nRationale for TICAP Approach to Developing PDC \n\nIn the June 23, 2021, public meeting,11 NRC staff members posited that the description of PDC provided in the Introduction section of Appendix A of 10 CFR 50 (provided above) may be a regulatory requirement, such that, without directly relating/comparing design-specific PDC to ARDC, the above-described TICAP strategy of focusing the PDC strictly on functional design criteria may not comply with current NRC regulations and thus may require an exemption. Notably, this staff position did not reflect input from the Office of General Counsel. Moreover, in that same meeting, the NRC staff acknowledged that the ARDC \u201c . . . are not considered to be final or binding regarding what may eventually be required from a nonLWR applicant.\u201d12 This position that the ARDC are not binding is consistent with the established \n\nunderstanding of a regulatory guide as being one of multiple methods for meeting regulatory expectations.13 \n\nFrom the perspective of the TICAP team, the TICAP proposal is sufficient to satisfy the basic requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(a)(3)(i) or equivalent, and this methodology does not require exemptions because the proposed TICAP approach for describing the design-specific safety case (which includes describing PDC, CDC, and programmatic requirements): \n\nHas been shown to provide the information that covers the intent of the applicable safety concepts included in ARDC; and \u2022 Would include required design-specific safety features identified by the RIPB LMP approach that may not be included in the ARDC (or GDC).\n\n---\n\n**Source 95**\nAlthough it was mentioned during the tabletop meeting and will be stated in the MCRE tabletop report, it is worth clarifying that the comparison of RIPB-derived PDC to the list of GDC/ARDC was an \u201cacademic exercise.\u201d NEI 18-04 does not require performing a comparison of final PDC to the GDC/ARDC, and the TICAP guidance does not call for including information on such a comparison in the SAR. TICAP does not believe that generating the comparison should be a de facto requirement on an applicant that follows NEI 18-04, but this could be candidate topic for an upcoming TICAP workshop. \n\nIII. The NRC staff notes that Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 18-04 describes how you can use the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) at the beginning or at the end of the LMP process. If not used at the beginning of the LMP process, other tools such as a process hazards analysis (PHA) or a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) are used and then confirmed at the end of the LMP process via the PRA. However, the LMP did not appear to be used to develop frequency-consequence (F-C) curves (used for licensing basis event (LBE) identification and structure, system, and component (SSC) classification). How the PRA will be used to adjust the LBEs or SSC classification would be of interest to the NRC staff. \n\nIt is correct to say that a full iteration of the LMP process (as documented in NEI 18-04) has not yet been completed for MCRE; however, given the current maturity of the MCRE design and safety case, it was necessary to make assumptions to \u201csimulate\u201d a more complete safety case for MCRE in order to explore the TICAP guidance by exercising it. The adjusting of the LBEs and/or SSC classification as a MCRE PRA model is developed and matured would be the topic of an LMP-focused discussion; thus, a conversation on this topic would not be well-suited to discuss at the upcoming TICAP workshops. \n\nI. What inconsistencies, if any, were noted between the sample SAR content discussed during the MCRE tabletop and NRC expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Source 96**\nTo standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating a consistent approach to the development of application documents. \n\nThe TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, \u201cGuidance for a Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,\u201d (ADAMS Accession No. ML20091L698).\n\n---\n\n**Source 97**\nAs noted above, a more detailed discussion about the information and level of detail included in the SAR compared to what is available for the NRC staff audit will be a topic of conversation in the upcoming workshops between the NRC staff and the TICAP team. \n\nIV. It was insightful for the NRC staff to see how the LMP process is applied as well as the level of detail/complexity for developing a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a simple microreactor design. \n\nThank you for the observation. The eVinci Micro-Reactor tabletop report will document the lessons learned from completing the tabletop exercise. \n\nV. The tabletop exercise involved an approach used by Westinghouse to develop PDCs. Westinghouse went directly from development of the required safety functions (RSFs) to defining the PDCs. NEI 18-04 states (under Task 7) that for SSCs classified as SafetyRelated (SR), the Safety-Related Design Criteria (SRDCs) are derived from the Required Functional Design Criteria (RFDCs) that are in turn developed from the RSFs determined in the LBE selection process. RFDCs are taken down from the RSFs to a lower level and form a transition to SSC-level criteria. RFDCs are defined to capture design-specific criteria that may be used to supplement or modify the applicable General Design Criteria (GDCs) or Advanced Reactor Design Criteria (ARDCs) in the formulation of PDCs. This approach appeared to the observation team to result in gaps in information that would be incorporated into the SAR content. \n\nAccording to the TICAP guidance, the PDC are the RFDC, which (as noted in the observation) are derived directly from the RSFs. Therefore, in Chapter 5 of a SAR developed using the TICAP guidance, the RSFs and the RFDC/PDC would be presented. Chapter 6 would present the SR-SSCs and the SRDC. The presentation of the PDC in Chapter 5, including the associated additional information, is a topic that would be a good candidate to discuss during the upcoming workshops between the NRC staff and the TICAP team.\n\n---\n\n**Source 98**\nI. The tabletop exercise did not fully accomplish its goal of exercising the TICAP application content guidance. No SAR content was presented or discussed. Instead, the tabletop exercise was a \u201cmini\u201d version of the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP) tabletop exercise that was performed in 2020, using some revised design features (TRISO fuel) and only evaluating for principal design criteria (PDCs). (Note that the 2020 LMP tabletop exercise did not evaluate for PDCs.) The tabletop exercise also did not perform some of the analysis that would be expected for development of licensing basis events, required safety functions, and PDCs, such as not evaluating the failure of all important structures, systems, and components (SSCs) (heat pipes and fuel), not calculating parametric uncertainties and not performing external hazards assessment. \n\nAlthough the eVinci Micro-Reactor tabletop exercise did not explicitly develop example SAR content (like the other tabletop exercises), the primary focus was on the identification of PDC using the TICAP guidance. Also, while the above observation is correct in its identification that the LMP-based safety case for the eVinci Micro-Reactor design that was used for the TICAP tabletop exercise is not entirely complete, the exercise did accomplish its goal to exercise the TICAP guidance document and explore how to maximize the usefulness of the guidance in explaining how PDC are identified using the TICAP approach. PDC are required by regulation and were not addressed in detail by LMP; thus, this exercise was necessary to help ensure the gap between the guidance in NEI 18-04 (and endorsed in RG 1.233) was sufficiently bridged by the TICAP guidance document.\n\n---\n\n**Source 99**\nWith respect to the design of safety related SSCs, external events are addressed in Chapter 6 of the TICAP guidance through the DBEHLs and Safety Related Design Criteria. However, it may be possible to use the body of the tabletop report to communicate further context and details about the selection of external events beyond that which the TICAP guidance indicates should be included in the SAR. \n\nf. The VTR report states that a PRA self-assessment identified some gaps in Capability Category II requirements of the non-LWR PRA standard. It may be useful to specifically discuss the gaps and their resolutions in the PRA summary of the SAR or a peer review report for audit. \n\nThe NLWR PRA Standard requirements for peer review and configuration control and the NEI PRA Peer Review Guidance specify that peer review findings and dispositions be documented in the plant records and associated corrective actions programs. The dispositions of these findings is a rather dynamic process and is subject to frequent changes and this creates a major problem for inclusion in the SAR. Hence this matter is best handled via the on-site audit process. \n\nIII. What other clarifying questions, if any, does the NRC have based on NRC/INL team observations.\n\n---\n\n**Source 100**\nForm APC-2 (4-47)\n\n---\n\n", "topic": "TICAP Overview", "summary": "The user asked about TICAP; the assistant explained that it stands for Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Project, its role in safety analysis for non-light water reactors, the fundamental safety functions it covers, and its collaboration with ARCAP.", "retrieval_time": 0.836695671081543, "generation_time": 5.505696535110474, "guardrail_time": 10.977262020111084}
