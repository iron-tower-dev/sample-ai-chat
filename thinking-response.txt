The user is asking about a procedure that manages unescorted access. This sounds like it would be related to security procedures at Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. I should search for documents related to unescorted access procedures.

Let me start by searching the eDoc collection for documents related to unescorted access, as this would likely be a procedure document.Great! I found several documents related to unescorted access procedures. Based on the search results, I can see that there are at least two primary procedures that manage unescorted access:

1. **20DP-0SK40** - "PVNGS UNESCORTED ACCESS SCREENING" - This appears to be the main procedure for managing unescorted access, covering background investigations, screening processes, and all the requirements for unescorted access authorization.

2. **20DP-0SK39** - "Palo Verde Badging Procedure" - This procedure covers the badging process and is involved in managing unescorted access through the issuance of ACAD badges and management of access systems.

Let me get the latest revisions of these documents to provide the most current information.Now I have the latest revisions: 20DP-0SK40 Rev. 050 and 20DP-0SK39 Rev. 042. Based on the search results and the latest revision information, I can provide a comprehensive answer about which procedures manage unescorted access at Palo Verde.

From the search results, I can see that:

1. **20DP-0SK40** (PVNGS UNESCORTED ACCESS SCREENING) is the primary procedure that manages unescorted access. It covers:
   - Background investigations
   - Screening processes
   - Initial and updated unescorted access authorizations
   - Reinstatement processes
   - All regulatory requirements for fitness for duty and security screening

2. **20DP-0SK39** (Palo Verde Badging Procedure) is also involved in managing unescorted access through:
   - Issuance of ACAD badges
   - Management of access systems
   - Coordination with the unescorted access request workflow

The search results clearly show that 20DP-0SK40 is the main procedure for unescorted access management, while 20DP-0SK39 handles the badging and administrative aspects of unescorted access.
