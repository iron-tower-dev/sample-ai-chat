Based on my analysis of the Palo Verde procedures, there are two key procedures that manage unescorted access, with each serving different but complementary roles:

Primary Procedure: 20DP-0SK40 "Access Authorization" (Revision 050)
This is the main procedure that manages unescorted access authorization. It covers the comprehensive process including:

Initial, updated, and reinstated unescorted access authorization
Program elements and requirements for trustworthiness and reliability
Background investigations and screening processes
Fitness for Duty Program integration
Behavioral Observation Program
Access denial and review procedures

Supporting Procedure: 20DP-0SK39 "Palo Verde Badging Procedure" (Revision 042)
This procedure manages the physical aspects of unescorted access, specifically:

Badge issuance requirements for unescorted access
ACAD badge management and control
Verification of authorization requirements before issuing badges
Termination and reactivation of unescorted access badges [Source: {0A7369D5-0CBB-CB9E-97CD-828469F00000}][Source: {393DDF27-812F-C387-9E24-828469F00000}]
Answer to Your Question:

The procedure that manages unescorted access is 20DP-0SK40 "Access Authorization". This is the primary procedure that governs the authorization process for unescorted access, including all screening, evaluation, and approval requirements. The Palo Verde Badging Procedure (20DP-0SK39) supports this by managing the physical badge issuance process once authorization has been granted.
